Week 3 Assignment from CSC 421 at Depaul University (Fall 2019)
<p>
Program MSA (30 points) Implement the Find-maximum-subarray algorithm as a method in either Java or Python 3. Provide a main method in Java or code at the top level in Python to test your method. This main part should:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>fill an array or list of length 16 with randomly chosen positive and negative integer values in the range -32 to 32</li>
<li>call the implemented method, which should return the left and right indices of the maximum subarray and the sum of the subarray</li>
<li>print the original array and all three returned values</li>
</ul>
<p>
Call the program MSA.java or msa.py.
